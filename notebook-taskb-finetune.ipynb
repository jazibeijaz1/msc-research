The ðŸ¤— Datasets library is normally smart enough to detect when the function you pass to map has changed (and thus requires to not use the cache data). For instance, it will properly detect if you change the task in the first cell and rerun the notebook. ðŸ¤— Datasets warns you when it uses cached files, you can pass `load_from_cache_file=False` in the call to `map` to not use the cached files and force the preprocessing to be applied again.\n\nNote that we passed `batched=True` to encode the texts by batches together.
